# recamanVisual
Hoping to make a program which provides visualization of the Recamán Sequence

The Recamán Sequence is a cool math sequence.

The rules:
 1) Each time, you make an increasing step.
 2) If you can go backwards (the jump would result in a nonnegative, nontaken position), you do it. 
 Otherwise, go forward.
